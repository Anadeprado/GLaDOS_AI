# GLaDOS AI - Robot Project â€“ Hardware & AI Integration

# Project Description:
This project aims to build a real-life version of GLaDOS from Portal 2, combining robotics and advanced AI. The hardware involves constructing a suspended robotic structure with articulated movements to mimic GLaDOSâ€™s iconic design. On the software side, we use cutting-edge AI models for voice synthesis, natural language understanding, and behavior simulation to recreate her sarcastic, intelligent personality. The result is an interactive robot capable of realistic conversation and dynamic, character-driven responses.

## 1. Hardware Construction
The hardware phase involves creating a physical replica of GLaDOS with articulated mechanical components. The structure includes:
- A robotic armature system to replicate GLaDOS's signature suspended, animatronic movement.
- Servo motors and actuators for realistic articulation of the neck, head, and eye units.
- Embedded sensors such as microphones, cameras, and depth sensors to enable environmental awareness.
- A custom frame and mounting system to simulate her ceiling-mounted presence.

For this project have been used the awesome 3D printable parts from Ytec3D:

## 2. Software & AI Development
The software side focuses on imbuing GLaDOS with a personality and intelligence system using advanced AI models:
- Integration of natural language processing (NLP) models for realistic, context-aware dialogue generation.
- Voice synthesis and modulation to replicate GLaDOSâ€™s iconic voice, possibly using neural TTS systems.
- Emotion simulation and dynamic tone adjustment to capture her sarcastic and darkly humorous personality.
- Computer vision models for facial recognition, gesture tracking, and interaction with users.
- Behavioral scripting and reinforcement learning models to allow adaptive responses based on user input and long-term interaction.

## 3. Applications and Goals
The project aims to serve both as a technical showcase and an interactive art installation. It explores:
- The convergence of robotics and character AI.
- How fictional personalities can be modeled and sustained using real-time AI systems.
- Human-robot interaction in storytelling and entertainment contexts.

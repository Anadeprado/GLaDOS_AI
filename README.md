# GLaDOS_AI
This project recreates GLaDOS from Portal 2 as a real robot, combining mechanical design with advanced AI. It features articulated hardware and AI-driven voice, dialogue, and behavior to bring her personality to life through interactive, character-rich responses.

# Project Description: Building and Programming a GLaDOS-Inspired Robot

This project focuses on the design, construction, and intelligent programming of a physical robot modeled after GLaDOS, the iconic artificial intelligence from the Portal 2 video game. The initiative combines both hardware development and cutting-edge artificial intelligence to bring the character to life in the real world.

## 1. Hardware Construction
The hardware phase involves creating a physical replica of GLaDOS with articulated mechanical components. The structure includes:
- A robotic armature system to replicate GLaDOS's signature suspended, animatronic movement.
- Servo motors and actuators for realistic articulation of the neck, head, and eye units.
- Embedded sensors such as microphones, cameras, and depth sensors to enable environmental awareness.
- A custom frame and mounting system to simulate her ceiling-mounted presence.

## 2. Software & AI Development
The software side focuses on imbuing GLaDOS with a personality and intelligence system using advanced AI models:
- Integration of natural language processing (NLP) models for realistic, context-aware dialogue generation.
- Voice synthesis and modulation to replicate GLaDOSâ€™s iconic voice, possibly using neural TTS systems.
- Emotion simulation and dynamic tone adjustment to capture her sarcastic and darkly humorous personality.
- Computer vision models for facial recognition, gesture tracking, and interaction with users.
- Behavioral scripting and reinforcement learning models to allow adaptive responses based on user input and long-term interaction.

## 3. Applications and Goals
The project aims to serve both as a technical showcase and an interactive art installation. It explores:
- The convergence of robotics and character AI.
- How fictional personalities can be modeled and sustained using real-time AI systems.
- Human-robot interaction in storytelling and entertainment contexts.
